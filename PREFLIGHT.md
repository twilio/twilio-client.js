Preflight Test
==============

The SDK supports a preflight test API which can help determine Voice calling readiness. The API creates a test call and will provide information to help troubleshoot call related issues. This new API is a static member of the [Device](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/device#twilio-device) class and can be used by calling `Device.testPreflight(token, options)`. For example:

```ts
const preflightTest = Device.testPreflight(token, options);
```

## Parameters

### Token
`Device.testPreflight(token, options)` requires a [Twilio Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens) to initiate the test call. This access token will be passed directly to the [Device's constructor](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/device#setup) and will be used to connect to a TwiML app that you associated with your [Twilio Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens). In order to get better results, the TwiML app should be able to record audio from a microphone and play it back to the browser. Please see [Preflight Test TwiML App](PREFLIGHT_TWIML.md) for details.

### Options
The `options` parameter is a JavaScript object containing configuration settings. Available settings are listed below:

| Property | Default | Description |
|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| `codecPreferences` | `['pcmu', 'opus']` | An ordered list of preferred codecs. |
| `debug` | `false` | Can be `true` or `false`. Set this property to true to enable debug logging in your browser console. |
| `signalingTimeoutMs` | `10000` | Ammount of time to wait for setting up signaling connection. |

Events
------

The `PreflightTest` object that is returned by `Device.testPreflight(token, options)` is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter), and as such its events can be subscribed to via `preflightTest.on(eventName, handler)`. The following is a list of all supported events that might get emitted throughout the duration of the test.

#### .on('completed', handler(report))
Raised when `PreflightTest.status` has transitioned to `completed`. During this time, the `report` is available and ready to be inspected. In some cases, this will not trigger if the test encounters a fatal error prior connecting to Twilio. Example report:

```

#### .on('connected', handler())
Raised when `PreflightTest.status` has transitioned to `connected`. This means, the connection to Twilio has been established.

#### .on('failed', handler(error))
Raised when `PreflightTest.status` has transitioned to `failed`. This happens when establishing a connection to Twilio has failed or when a test call has encountered a fatal error. This is also raised if `PreflightTest.stop` is called while the test is in progress. The error emitted from this event is coming from [Device.on('error)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/device#error) and uses the same error format.

#### .on('sample', handler(sample))
This event is published every second and is raised when the [Connection](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/connection) gets a webrtc sample object. The `sample` object is coming from [Connection.on('sample')](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/connection#sample) and uses the same `sample` format.

#### .on('warning', handler(warningName, warningData))
Raised whenever the [Connection](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/connection) encounters a warning. This is coming from [Connection.on('warning')](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/connection#onwarning-handlerwarningname) and uses the same API format.

Properties
----------
You can access the following properties on the `PreflightTest` object:

* `callSid` - The callsid generated for the test call. This is set when the client has finished connecting to Twilio.
* `endTime` - A timestamp in milliseconds of when the test ended. This is set when the test has completed and raised the `completed` event.
* `latestSample` - The latest WebRTC sample collected. This is set whenever the connection emits a `sample`. Please see [Connection.on('sample')](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/javascript/connection#sample) API for more details.
* `report` - The report for this test. This is set when the test has completed and raised the `completed` event.
* `startTime` - A timestamp in milliseconds of when the test started. This is set right after calling `Device.testPreflight(token, options)`.
* `status` - The status of the test. Below are the possible values for this property.

  | Value | Description |
  |:------|:------------|
  | Completed | The connection to Twilio has been disconnected and the test call has completed. |
  | Connected | The connection to Twilio has been established. |
  | Connecting | Connecting to Twilio has started. |
  | Failed | The test has stopped and failed. |

Methods
-------

#### .stop()

Calling this method from the `PreflightTest` object will stop the existing test and will raise a `failed` event with an error code `31008` indicating that the call has been cancelled.
