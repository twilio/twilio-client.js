## Migration from twilio-client.js 1.x
This product, Twilio's JavaScript Voice SDK, is the next version of Twilio's Javascript Client SDK. It is
now in GA and we recommend all customers migrate in order to continue receiving future feature additions.
For help on migrating from 1.x, see our [migration guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/client/migrating-to-js-voice-sdk-20).

#### Pilot Versioning Note
During the pilot phase, the GitHub release artifact was referred to as `2.0.0`. This has been retroactively corrected
to the appropriate tag, `2.0.0-preview.1`. With GA, we move to `2.0.0` formally. This versioning fix was necessary
to properly follow semantic versioning rules.

Installation
------------

### NPM

We recommend using `npm` to add the Voice SDK as a dependency.

```
npm install @twilio/voice-sdk --save
```

Using this method, you can `import` the Voice SDK using ES Module or TypeScript syntax:

```js
import { Device } from '@twilio/voice-sdk';

```

Or using CommonJS:

```js
const Device = require('@twilio/voice-sdk').Device;
```

### CDN
As of 2.0, the Twilio Voice SDK is no longer hosted via CDN.

### GitHub

Although we recommend using `npm` to add the Voice SDK as a dependency, you can also get the Twilio Voice SDK code
from GitHub and include it in your project directly. To do so, navigate to
["Releases"](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-voice.js/releases) and find the most recent release, or
the particular release version you'd like to use.

> **Note:** releases tagged with "-rc" are "Release Candidate" versions
> and are still being tested. Unless you specifically know that you want to use a release candidate
> version, you should not use a release with "-rc" in the name.

Download either the `zip` or the `tar.gz` and then extract the files. For example, if you downloaded the
tarball for the `2.0.0` release, you could then extract the files with the `tar` command:

```
tar -xvzf twilio-voice.js-2.0.0.tar.gz
cd twilio-voice.js-2.0.0
```

Once you've extracted the folder, the `twilio.js` and `twilio.min.js` files that
you can include in your project will be in the `/dist` directory. `twilio.min.js` is the
minified version of the code.

You can copy either the `twilio.js` or the `twilio.min.js` file into your project and
then provide a link to it in your html. For example:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="twilio.min.js"></script>
```

Using this method, you can access the SDK through the browser global:

```
const Device = Twilio.Device;
```

Testing
-------

Running unit tests requires no setup aside from installation (above). You can run unit tests via:

```
npm run test:unit
```

Integration tests require some set up:

1. If the account you want to use doesn't already have a TwiML app set up, create one using the
   TwiML code below.
2. Copy config.example.yaml to config.yaml, replacing the placeholder information with valid credentials.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Dial>
    <Client>
      <Identity>{{To}}</Identity>
      <Parameter name="duplicate" value="12345" />
      <Parameter name="duplicate" value="123456" />
      <Parameter name="custom + param" value="我不吃蛋" />
      <Parameter name="foobar" value="some + value" />
      <Parameter name="custom1" value="{{Custom1}}" />
      <Parameter name="custom2" value="{{Custom2}}" />
      <Parameter name="custom3" value="{{Custom3}}" />
    </Client>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

Integration tests can be run via:

```
npm run test:integration
```

These tests will run via karma, one at a time, in your system's default Chrome and then Firefox.

Content Security Policy (CSP)
----------------------------

Use the following policy directives to enable [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) that is compatible with twilio-voice.js.

connect-src https://eventgw.twilio.com wss://chunderw-vpc-gll.twilio.com https://media.twiliocdn.com https://sdk.twilio.com
```

If you are providing a non-default value for `Device.ConnectOptions.edge` parameter, you need to add the Signaling URI `wss://chunderw-vpc-gll-{regionId}.twilio.com` in your `connect-src` directive where `regionId` is the `Region ID` as defined in this [page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/global-infrastructure/edge-locations/legacy-regions). See examples below.

**If `Device.ConnectOptions.edge` is `ashburn`**

```
connect-src https://eventgw.twilio.com https://media.twiliocdn.com https://sdk.twilio.com wss://chunderw-vpc-gll-us1.twilio.com
```

**If `Device.ConnectOptions.edge` is `['ashburn', 'sydney', 'roaming']`**
